# ▶️ 👉🏻 🗑 Delete Workflow Runs 

Easily mass-delete GitHub Workflow runs from your GitHub remote repository via the command line.

Conventiently select multiple entries to be deleted at once from a navigable list.

It uses the GitHub API, and requires gh (GitHub CLI) and jq (JSON processor).

## QuickStart

1. Install pre-requisites [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli), [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for example on `MacOS`:
    ```sh
    $ brew install gh jq fzf
    ```

2. Install `delete-workflow-runs` globally:
    ```sh
    $ npm i -g delete-workflow-runs
    ```
3. Authenticate to GitHub via `gh` client:
    ```sh
    $ gh auth login
    ```
    Follow the prompts in the terminal wizard to authenticate.

4. Navigate to the directory of the repository that you wish to delete workflow runs from, then run:
    ```sh
    $ delete-workflow-runs
    ```
5. Use the `<up>` and `<down>` keys to navigate the list of workflow runs, and select the ones to be deleted with `<tab>`.

6. Press `<enter>` to delete the runs from your GitHub remote.
